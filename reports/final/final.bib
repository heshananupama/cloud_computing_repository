abstract="Container technologies are changing the way cloud platforms and distributed applications are architected and managed. Containers are used to run enterprise, scientific and big data applications, to architect IoT and edge/fog computing systems, and by cloud providers to internally manage their infrastructure and services. However, we are far away from the maturity stage and there are still many research challenges to be solved. One of them is container orchestration that makes it possible to define how to select, deploy, monitor, and dynamically control the configuration of multi-container packaged applications in the cloud. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art solutions and discusses research challenges in autonomic orchestration of containers. A reference architecture of an autonomic container orchestrator is also proposed.",
